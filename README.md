# HelpDeskChat
The Plot:
- Our beloved operators would like to have a chat application integrated with Caiman Help Desk to make it easier for staff to keep tabs on all support communication with players.  Upon call wrap-up, the chat thread will be saved as part of the player notes.
- To ease Operator agents into this chat application, we have decided to roll out a Chatroom version of this app where staff can communicate both on a professional and social level at work and everywhere

Stack:
- Polymer 1.0
- Firebase

- Getting started on Polymer development
